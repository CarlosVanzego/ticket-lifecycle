During the Intake stage, a ticket is created by a user or customer to report an issue or request assistance. The ticket should include relevant details such as a clear description of the problem, any error messages, and relevant attachments if necessary. The ticket is then submitted through the osTicket system, which generates a unique ticket number for tracking purposes.

In the Assignment and Communication stage, the ticket is assigned to an appropriate support agent or team based on the nature of the issue. The assigned agent receives a notification about the new ticket and begins to assess and communicate with the user. This stage involves gathering additional information, clarifying details, and discussing potential solutions or workarounds. osTicket provides a communication channel within the ticket interface, enabling seamless back-and-forth conversations between the agent and the user.

Once the necessary information has been gathered, the Working the Issue stage begins. The assigned agent analyzes the problem, troubleshoots the issue, and implements necessary fixes or solutions. They may need to collaborate with other team members, consult knowledge bases or resources, or perform additional research. Throughout this stage, the agent updates the ticket with progress notes, keeping the user informed of the actions taken and any relevant findings.

Finally, in the Resolution stage, the agent completes the resolution process and provides a response or solution to the user. This can involve explaining the steps taken, providing guidance on how to avoid similar issues in the future, or delivering a fix or workaround. The agent updates the ticket with the resolution details and marks it as resolved. The user is notified of the resolution and has the opportunity to provide feedback or reopen the ticket if needed.
